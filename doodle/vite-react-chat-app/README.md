As you can see from my commit history I did the work over a 10 hour period on Thursday, Dec 21. I also did some worked not logged in my commits on Wednesday, Dec 20. I was working on it sporadically as I had various *commit*ments during the day. Below are my answers to the questions in the challenge.

It is OK if the challenge is not completed:

*✓ check (I did not complete)*

Try to prioritize it by what you think is more important:

*I wanted to get the JavaScript working. I started by building out a mock login screen to toggle the users. As in the requirements it says the app should be "able to send and display messages from all senders". I spent my last 30 minutes working on the CSS.*

Tell us what motivated your technology choices:

*I chose React (with Vite) and vanilla CSS(3) and HTML(5). I felt React would be the best choice for a reactive application. It would be easy to read and understand and there would be less code to write.*

how you tackled the task:

*I hope my approach is clear from my commit messages. I started with the mock login, then worked on the POST request, moved to the GET request, and did some refactoring along the way.*

what you would do differently were you given more time:

*I would've built a working app, which means iterating over the old messages to display them instead of hard coding them, converted the timestamp into a date, refactored into components, and completed the CSS.*

what you would differently a second time around:

*I believe I could’ve broken my commit messages into smaller chunks, especially with the CSS. I would’ve brushed up on my CSS skills, and completed the CSS. I would’ve tested performance, and accessibility.*

Best,
